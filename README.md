# eltainer

A pure Emacs Lisp porcelain for **Docker and Kubernetes**, fronted by
a single magit-style UI.

![eltainer dashboard + docker exec](docs/exec-demo.gif)

*`M-x eltainer` opens a dashboard listing every available view in
both backends, including the currently-active kubeconfig context.
`c` jumps to the docker containers list; `e` on a row opens a real
shell inside the container via HTTP Upgrade hijack of
`POST /exec/{id}/start`, rendered in `eat`.  `b` switches Kubernetes
contexts the way `b` switches branches in magit.  No `docker` CLI
or `kubectl` involved.*

## Philosophy

**Pure Elisp talking directly to the daemon.**

eltainer speaks HTTP/1.1 to the Docker daemon over its Unix socket
**and** HTTPS to the Kubernetes API server.  Both halves share one
transport, one streaming/event pipeline, one terminal abstraction.
JSON via native `json-parse-*`, TLS via built-in GnuTLS; the package
refuses to load without the former and refuses to TLS-connect
without the latter.

CLI fallbacks are kept *only* for things the engine APIs genuinely
can't do — `docker build` (BuildKit gRPC), `docker compose`, CLI
plugins, `docker login` config writes, `DOCKER_HOST=ssh://…`
transport, `docker-credential-*` helpers, and Kubernetes
`users.exec` plugins (`aws eks get-token`, `gke-gcloud-auth-plugin`,
…).  Each is one clearly-named function in one place.  See
[docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md).

## What you can do

`M-x eltainer` is the home screen.  From there, single-key launchers:

| Backend | Key | View |
|---------|-----|------|
| Docker | `c` | Containers (running; `a` toggles all) |
| Docker | `I` | Images |
| Docker | `N` | Networks (+ connected containers) |
| Docker | `u` | Pull image (streamed per-layer progress) |
| Kubernetes | `k` | Pods grouped by namespace |
| Kubernetes | `d` | Deployments |
| Kubernetes | `s` | Services |
| Kubernetes | `S` | StatefulSets |
| Kubernetes | `D` | DaemonSets |
| Kubernetes | `j` / `J` | Jobs / CronJobs |
| Kubernetes | `i` | Ingresses |
| Kubernetes | `m` / `x` | ConfigMaps / Secrets |
| Kubernetes | `o` | Nodes (roles, conditions, live perf gauges) |
| Kubernetes | `A` | Sandboxes (agent-sandbox SIG — `agents.x-k8s.io`) |
| — | `b` | Switch Kubernetes context (across all discovered kubeconfigs) |
| — | `g` | Refresh dashboard |

`M-x docker` and `M-x k8s` still work directly and bypass the
dashboard if that's what you want.

### Inside any docker view

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `?` | Transient dispatch menu |
| `g` | Refresh |
| `q` | Quit window |
| `RET` | Toggle section / DWIM |
| `i` | Inspect resource at point |
| `d` | Delete / disconnect (context-aware) |
| `a` | Toggle running-only vs. all (containers view) |
| `F` | Narrow by label selector (`F l`) / name regex (`F n`); engine `?filters=` for labels (equality only — `!=` / `!key` are unsupported on docker) |
| `s` `S` `r` `K` | Start / Stop / Restart / Kill container |
| `l` | Tail logs (streaming, stdout / stderr demuxed) |
| `e` | Exec a shell inside the container (TTY) |
| `f` | Browse the container's filesystem (real dired-mode buffer; containers view) |
| In the FS browser: `D R C + I C-x C-q` | Delete / rename / copy / mkdir / import-from-host / wdired |
| `D` | DNS lookup from inside the container (`getent` → `nslookup` → `/etc/resolv.conf`+`/etc/hosts`) |
| `M` | Per-container metrics buffer (containers view) |
| `j` `J` | Join / leave a network |

Views auto-refresh as the daemon's `/events` stream tells us what
changed (debounced).  The TTY exec lands in an
[`eat`](https://codeberg.org/akib/emacs-eat) buffer — eat is a hard
dependency (see [Requirements](#requirements)).

`TAB` on a running container shows live gauges — CPU% (with a
`throttled` note when it's hitting its CFS limit), memory, block-I/O
and network throughput sparklines, and the PID count — polled from
`/containers/{id}/stats`.  `M` opens a focused, self-refreshing
metrics buffer for the container.

*The metrics gauges in action across both backends — see
[docs/DEMO.md](docs/DEMO.md).*

### Inside the k8s view

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `?` | Context-aware dispatch — actions for the resource under point, plus `v` for the view switcher |
| `g` | Refresh |
| `N` | Switch namespace |
| `F` | Narrow this view (`F l` label selector, `F n` name regex, `F c` clear) — labels go server-side via `?labelSelector=`; name-regex is client-side |
| `w` | Toggle live watch (auto-update via the K8s watch API) |
| `b` | Switch kubeconfig context (same picker as from the dashboard) |
| `i` | Describe resource |
| `l` | Tail pod logs (pods view); on a Deployment / StatefulSet / DaemonSet / Job / Service, opens a multi-pod tail (each pod colored distinctly); on a CronJob, tails the last run |
| `m` / `u` / `U` / `t` / `DEL` | dired-style marks: mark / unmark / unmark-all / toggle / unmark-backward (works in any view) |
| `L` | Multipod tail of every marked pod (pods view) |
| In any log view: `n` / `p` navigate, `P` pause/resume the stream, current line highlighted |
| `e` | Interactive TTY exec into the pod (pods view only) |
| `f` | Browse the pod's filesystem (real dired-mode buffer; pods view only) |
| In the FS browser: `D R C + I C-x C-q` | Delete / rename / copy / mkdir / import-from-host / wdired |
| `D` | DNS lookup from inside the pod (`getent` → `nslookup` → `/etc/resolv.conf`+`/etc/hosts`) |
| `M` | Per-pod metrics buffer (pods view only) |
| `T` | Open the xray tree for the workload at point (Deployment / STS / DS / Job / CronJob / RS / Service / Pod) |
| `Y` | Edit the YAML of the resource at point; `C-c C-c` PUTs the change back |
| `S` `R` `K` | Scale / rollout-restart / force-kill the workload at point |
| `c` `D` | Cordon-toggle / drain (Nodes view) |
| `C-u l` | Show the *previous* container run's logs (after a crash) |
| `d` | Delete resource (with confirmation) |
| `TAB` | Expand / collapse section |
| `RET` on an Ingress backend row | Jump to the referenced Service in the services view |
| In the services view: `IN/s` + `OUT/s` columns | Aggregate of each Service's backing pods' network counters (kubelet Summary); `M` opens a per-Service sparkline buffer |

`?` is **context-aware** — the first group of the menu reflects
whatever the cursor is on (a pod, a container, or another resource),
so it only ever offers actions that apply there.  `l` / `e` / `f` /
`M` on a container row target that container directly.

`TAB` on a pod expands it to show its containers, each as its own
section — point on a container row makes `l` / `e` / `f` target that
container directly (no picker).  Expanded containers also show live
CPU, memory and disk gauges (with trend sparklines), and the pod
gets a network rx/tx sparkline — CPU/memory need metrics-server,
disk/network need the kubelet stats API; each degrades gracefully if
unavailable.  `M` opens a focused, self-refreshing metrics buffer
for the pod.

### The Nodes view

`o` (on the dashboard, or `?` → `o` from any k8s view) opens the
cluster Nodes view — every node with its roles, status, kubelet
version and age.  `TAB` expands a node to its conditions (including
the `MemoryPressure` / `DiskPressure` / `PIDPressure` flags),
capacity vs. allocatable, scheduled-pod count, addresses, OS /
kernel / container-runtime and taints.  Each node carries live
CPU / memory / disk gauges (metrics-server + the kubelet stats API)
and the buffer self-refreshes.

When a Prometheus is reachable in the cluster, the Nodes view
enriches each node with load averages (1m / 5m / 15m) and swaps the
short in-buffer sparklines for real hour-long CPU / memory trends.
eltainer queries Prometheus *through the Kubernetes API server's
service proxy* — it reuses the existing authenticated connection,
so there is no port-forward and no second set of credentials.  The
Prometheus Service is auto-discovered; override it with
`eltainer-prometheus-service` (`"namespace/name:port"`), or set
that to `disabled` to switch the integration off.  With no
Prometheus the view simply omits those rows.

### Switching contexts

`b` (on the dashboard *or* any k8s view) enumerates every context
across every discovered kubeconfig file (`$KUBECONFIG`, anything
under `~/.kube` and `~/.kube/configs`, plus
`eltainer-kubeconfig-extra-paths`).  Pick one and the dashboard
flips immediately: any open `*k8s:…*` buffers are killed so they
re-open against the new context the next time you visit them.
Same muscle memory as `b` in magit for branches.

### Stopping everything

`M-x eltainer-stop-all` is the panic button.  It kills every
`*docker:*` / `*k8s:*` / `*eltainer:*` buffer (each one's
kill-hooks cancel its timers and close its streams), tears down
the global Docker `/events` stream, and sweeps any orphan
eltainer-owned timer the kill-hooks didn't catch.  Live exec TTY
buffers are left alone by default — killing them drops a shell;
pass a prefix arg (`C-u M-x eltainer-stop-all`) to include those
too.

Metrics polling defaults to once every 30 seconds — tune via
`docker-metrics-refresh-interval` and `k8s-metrics-refresh-interval`.

## Requirements

- Emacs 30+ with native JSON (`json-parse-string`) and, for any TLS
  target, GnuTLS (`gnutls-available-p`).  eltainer refuses to load
  without the former and refuses to TLS-connect without the latter.
- `magit-section`, `transient`.
- [`eat`](https://codeberg.org/akib/emacs-eat) (`M-x package-install
  RET eat RET` from MELPA / NonGNU ELPA).  Pure-Elisp xterm emulator;
  the sole supported terminal backend for `e` (interactive exec) in
  both Docker and Kubernetes views.  `eltainer-terminal.el` refuses
  to load without it.

  Why insist on eat?  The docker-exec and k8s-exec paths feed bytes
  through a custom process filter (HTTP-Upgrade hijack for Docker,
  WebSocket framing for Kubernetes).  built-in `term-mode` only
  renders bytes from an Emacs subprocess's stdout, and `vterm`
  doesn't expose a clean byte-injection seam — both silently no-op
  in this codebase.  eat does the right thing
  (`eat-term-process-output`) and is pure-Elisp, so it's a no-cost
  dep.
- A running Docker daemon and / or a kubeconfig.

## What's new

See [`NEWS.md`](NEWS.md) for a reverse-chronological log of
user-visible changes (new keys, new views, UX shifts).

## Quick start

```elisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/eltainer")
(require 'eltainer)

;; Then any of:
;;   M-x eltainer          ; dashboard listing every view + active context
;;   M-x docker            ; jump straight to docker containers
;;   M-x k8s               ; jump straight to k8s pods
```

For development:

```elisp
(load "/path/to/eltainer/reload.el")
;; M-x eltainer-reload       ; byte-compile + reload + re-enter open buffers
```

## Tests

ERT suites under `test/`.  The pure-Elisp suite has no daemon / cluster
dependency; the integration suites in `test/docker/` and `test/k8s/`
hit a real Docker daemon / kubeconfig and `skip-unless` cleanly when
neither is reachable.

```
make test       # pure-Elisp unit tests only (parsers, path arithmetic,
                # the `-F'-listing-switches regression, USTAR header parsing)
make test-all   # everything, including live-daemon + live-cluster integration
make compile    # clean + byte-compile every .el (no tests; CI sanity check)
```

Add a test whenever you change JSON parsing, magit-section rendering,
metrics math, watch handling, or API-path construction (per CLAUDE.md).
The fixture / replay system in `docs/test-fixtures-plan.md` is still
proposal — the existing integration tests just exercise live state.

## Demo

The GIF up top is regenerated by `docs/record-demo.sh` (requires
[asciinema](https://asciinema.org/) and
[agg](https://github.com/asciinema/agg) — `brew install agg`).  It
spins up a sentinel container, scripts an `emacs -nw` session
through [`docs/demo-init.el`](docs/demo-init.el), records with
asciinema, and converts to GIF.
