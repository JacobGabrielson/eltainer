                  Byte-compile, drop the feature, `load' fresh.
  `reloaded'   — `.elc' is up-to-date.  Skip the byte-compile (the
                  expensive step) but still `load' the file so the
                  running session matches what's on disk.  Important:
                  this picks up a `.elc' freshly produced by
                  `make compile' in a shell, even though no `.el'
                  was edited inside Emacs.
  `error'      — byte-compile reported failure.

`load' is always called.  It's cheap when the .elc is already in
the session; doing it unconditionally means `eltainer-reload' is
predictable -- it always brings the running session in sync with
disk.  Byte-compile is the only thing we ever skip."
